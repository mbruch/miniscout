miniscout
=========
Miniscout is a training project for learning the nuts and bolts of Eclipse and OSGi
before learning about Eclipse Scout. Essentially, the app is a simple "form editor" that
uses dynamic OSGI services to load and store data, extension points to render different
field types of a form, and illustrates the core concepts of the OSGI runtime.


Prerequisites
-------------
Eclipse 4.3 M7 RCP or Scout Package.
